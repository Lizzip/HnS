BASIC GAME-COMPLETE IDEA?
----------------------------------------------

- 5 Levels
- Level difficulty increases as you progress
- Level composed of waves of enemies followed by a level boss
- Enemies attack as they reach you
- Stamina use for special/strong attacks
- Enemies have a chance to drop stam and health potions

- As character doesn't *really* move, level movement/progression should be done on 
  a counter that increases as you move right, and decreases as you move left.
